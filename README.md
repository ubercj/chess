CHESS

RUBY FINAL PROJECT

This is the most difficult project I've tackled yet - building a command-line Chess game completely on my own without any hints. It had to allow for two players to play against one another (with bonus points for creating a Computer with a simple AI to play against). It also had to allow you to save the game at any time and load it back up again later.

This project really tested me and taught me a lot. I hit a lot of walls. I jotted down a lot of pseudocode and did a lot of "rubber ducking." In the end, I managed to include every bit of functionality I wanted, including the annoying edge cases like en passant and castling.

The most important thing I learned from this project is that if there's something I want to do and I can say it in words, then I can put it in code. It's an empowering feeling! Some of the methods do too many things at once, and the code could be cleaner, but at the end of the day, I'm really proud of what I was able to accomplish on my own.
